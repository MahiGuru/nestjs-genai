  private generateExplanationResponse(input: string): string {
    return `## Understanding Your Question

Let me break down the concept you're asking about:

### Core Principles

The fundamental idea revolves around understanding how modern applications handle data flow and user interactions in real-time environments.

### How It Works

**1. Input Processing**
- System receives and validates user input using strict type checking
- Data is sanitized and transformed according to business rules
- Validation layers ensure data integrity throughout the pipeline

**2. Real-time Communication**
- WebSocket connections enable bidirectional communication
- Event-driven architecture ensures responsive user experiences
- Message queuing handles high-throughput scenarios

**3. Response Generation**
- AI-powered processing analyzes user intent
- Context-aware responses are generated based on conversation history
- Markdown formatting provides rich, readable output

### Best Practices for 2025

**Modern Development Standards:**
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implement proper error boundaries and graceful degradation
- Follow microservices architecture for scalability
- Use container orchestration for deployment

**Performance Optimization:**
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Use lazy loading and code splitting for better UX
- Optimize bundle sizes with tree shaking
- Monitor performance with real-time analytics

### Real-World Applications

This pattern is extensively used in:
- **Chat Applications**: Real-time messaging with AI assistance
- **Collaborative Tools**: Multi-user editing and communication
- **Customer Support**: Automated response systems with human fallback
- **Data Analytics**: Real-time dashboards and reporting

The approach ensures both scalability and maintainability while providing excellent user experiences.`;

  private generateAnalysisResponse(input: string): string {
    return `## Comprehensive Analysis

### Executive Summary

Based on your input: **"${input}"**, here's a detailed analysis considering current technology trends and best practices.

### Key Findings

**Strengths Identified:**
- Clear communication of requirements and objectives
- Focus on practical implementation over theoretical concepts
- Alignment with modern development practices
- Consideration for user experience and interface design

**Areas for Optimization:**
- Implementation could benefit from modern architectural patterns
- Performance considerations should be prioritized early
- Scalability planning needs to be incorporated from the start
- Security measures should be built-in, not bolted-on

### Technical Recommendations

**Architecture & Design:**
1. **Microservices Approach**: Break down functionality into discrete, manageable services
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use event sourcing for better data consistency
3. **API-First Design**: Ensure all components communicate through well-defined APIs
4. **Container Orchestration**: Use Docker and Kubernetes for deployment flexibility

**Technology Stack (2025 Standards):**
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript for robust server-side development
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with Next.js for optimal performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- **Real-time**: WebSockets with Socket.io for instant communication
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment

### Market Analysis

**Current Trends:**
- AI integration is becoming standard, not optional
- Real-time features are expected by users
- Mobile-first design is crucial for adoption
- Privacy and security are top user concerns

**Competitive Advantages:**
- Clean, intuitive user interface design
- Fast response times and reliable performance
- Comprehensive feature set without complexity
- Strong security and privacy protections

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Core infrastructure and basic functionality
**Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): User interface development and testing
**Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Advanced features and optimization
**Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Security hardening and deployment preparation

### Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Target 85%+ user retention after 30 days
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times for 95% of requests
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production

This analysis provides a strategic foundation for making informed decisions about implementation priorities and resource allocation.`;
